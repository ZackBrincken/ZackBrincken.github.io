						Right now, I am living at home with my parents and brother in Springfield, Illnois. I am currently working as an intern for the Illinois State Police Department of Human Resources with the primary focus of reorganizing their file system. During the Fall and Spring semesters, I live and go to school in Edwardsville, Illinois. Soon my family and I will be going on an Alaskan cruise and I am really looking forward to that! I am not sure exactly what there is to see, but I am ready for all of it! I am also taking a summer course through SIUE at the moment and am enjoying working on that. Another interesting part of my life is that I have lived with at least three and usually four cats for practically all of it. My mom loves them maybe a bit too much... There is not much else going on in my life at the momemnt, but I enjoy the relaxation!

								I have been playing guitar since I was 7 years old and it is a major part of who I am. Bands like Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer raised me and I could not help but start playing myself. Although I have branched out musically since then, Megadeth's "Holy Wars... the Punishment Due" probably remains the most important song in my life.<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								I have also been gaming for practically my whole life. The first one I ever played was Everquest while I sat on my dad's lap and, from there, I never stopped. Today my all-time favorite game is probably Terraria although I have almost certainly played Minecraft more than anything else. Some of my other favorites include Overwatch, Elden Ring, Call of Duty: Black Ops II and III, and Baldur's Gate 3. Gaming has become a core part of who I am, and I do not plan on stopping until the day I die.
